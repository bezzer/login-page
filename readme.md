# Sample login page
## About
This project implements a simple login form using react and redux.

## Usage
1. Click `login` button - this will display a login form with `username` and 
`password` fields
2. Fill in the login form
3. Submit the form - if the both fields pass their respective validation rules, 
wait approximately half a second (to mimic hitting an API) then either display 
a "success" or "error" message

Field validation rules:
* `username` must be at least 4 characters long
* `password` must be at least 4 characters long and contain at least one 
non-alphabetical character

After the half-second delay, the login should be considered successful if the 
password is the username backwards. This should ignore all non-alphanumeric 
characters and be a case insensitive comparison. E.g.

## Building the project
